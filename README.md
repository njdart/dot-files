#Dot Files
=========

I use BSPWM on Arch linux on both my desktop and laptops, here are some configurations for them :)

I've tried to automate this as much as possible. Running the `setup.py` file (python3) should symblink everything into place. Running it as root should also get the job done for you, but will symblink things like `mpd.conf` into place too.
